## Schengen Visa Calculator

This is a simple React/NextJS/Firebase app for calculating the number of visa free days remaining to the user given the constraint of a maximum stay of 90 days in a rolling 180 day period. Originally the project used Auth0 and AWS DynamoDB. The AWS Lambda function used by the API remains for reference.
